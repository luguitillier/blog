## interfaces vs types

## empty types

- differences between never / null / undefined / void

ref: https://dev.to/aumayeung/typescript-data-types-null-void-undefined-never-and-object-432h

```
The never type is a sub-type of, and is assignable to, every type. However, no type is a sub-type of, or assignable to, the never type except for other never variables.
```

```js
const x: never = 1

const bla = (p): never => 1

const y: number = bla(1)
```
